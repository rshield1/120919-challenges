=begin
Use the method defined below that accepts two arguments:
  The first argument will always be an array of strings
  The second argument could be either a String OR an Integer

First, you will need to check what data type the second argument is
  Hint: Check out these two methods to help figure that out!
    https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Object/class
    https://apidock.com/ruby/Object/is_a%3F

If the second argument is an INTEGER you will want to RETURN a new array
that ONLY includes the elements that have more letters than that integer

If the second argument is a STRING you will want to return a new array that
only includes the elements that have that string as a substring
