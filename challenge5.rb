  Use the method defined below that accepts an array of integers as an argument
  The method should return a hash with four key-value pairs:
  - length
  - first_index
  - last_index
  - maximum_value

  The length key should have a value of the length of the array
  The first_index key should have a value of the first element in the array
  The last_index key should have a value of the last element in the array
  The maximum_value key should have a value of the hightest integer in the array
